# Contributing

## Pull requests are welcome!

Come [join the Discord channel](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ANPA/discussions/0/487876568238532577/) to discuss the project
(see the "nt_semantic_sequels" and other related channels under Architects).

See BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS in this repo for getting started.

It's recommended you fork the dev branch, and pull request your work there back to origin/dev.
The dev branch will periodically get merged back to the master branch, as new things become stable enough.

## On code style

No big restrictions, just try to more or less match the other SDK code style. Valve likes to ( space ) their arguments,
especially with macros, but it's not necessary. Tabs are preferred for whitespace, to be consistent with the SDK code.
